The data used to send and receive bitcoins and other crypto-currencies through the bitcoin network and the Paymon network are encrypted and maximally protected. The private key uniquely coincides with the Wallet’s address and should be used to transfer cryptocurrencies.
/n
/n8.3. You are solely responsible for ensuring the security of your private key and backup. You must keep your Wallet address, backup and private key secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of the cryptocurrencies tied to the wallet.
